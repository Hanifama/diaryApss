Data Management Application Using DOM and Web Storage with features

able to add new book data, stored book data is an object with the following structure: { id:strings | number, title: strings, author: strings, year: number, isComplete: boolean, } The book id for each book stored must be unique. A tip in setting a value for is that you can take advantage of timestamp values. To get the timestamp value in JavaScript is quite easy, simply by writing expressions +new Date().

has at least two bookshelves, namely "unfinished reading" and "finished reading", "Unfinished reading" bookshelf only saves books if the isComplete property is false. The "Completed reading" bookshelf only holds books if the isComplete property is true, and if the bookshelf is empty then the info appears "No books here" and vice versa.

can move books between shelves

can delete book data

can search for book data

take advantage of localStorage in storing book data

The application can function properly (no bugs, no experience force close, application functionality goes well, etc.)
